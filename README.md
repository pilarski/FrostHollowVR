# The Frost Hollow (Virtual Reality Implementation)
A virtual reality (VR) environment for studying temporal decision making and signalling between a human and an artifical intelligence (AI) agent, characterized by a sparse reward reinforcement learning problem, audio+visual+vibrotactile stimulus, and partially observable domain mechanics.

Please note: this project requires SteamVR or another VR package set for Unity; specific SteamVR settings and files have been excluded from this repository, so some work may be required to re-insert the VR rigging approach when deploying the project on a new machine or with new hardware. Importantly, the main experimental code is attached to the camera gameObject inside the VR Rig, so please note this will need to be moved to a new rig if one is used. Similarly, updates may be required to bring this project up to date with current Unity LTS version used on the target machine.
